# CTiB

This is the experiment of using GitHub for version control and files in
the course CTiB autumn 2021.

## Project outline
The aim of the project is to learn how to manage GitHub and get more
confident in Python programming with a bioinformatic focus.

The project was set up as a way of organising private notes and code
snippets that demonstrate growing experience with Python and will act
as a portfolio of competences.
